# la_pinata
A python game where you hit a piñata.

Download freely. You will need python and pygame to run this game (I use python 3.9.0). I run by typing (in a terminal):

  python3.9 la_pinata.py

Press 'p' or click "Play" to play.

To walk forward use the up arrow, backwards with the down arrow. Turn left with the left arrow and right with the right arrow.

Press spacebar to swing the piñata, when the candy falls press 'c' to pickup candy.

If the song ends before you burst the piñata you lose a life. If you touch another child you lose a life. You begin with 7 lives.

If you would like to quit, press 'q' or quit python.

Have fun.
